# Me

My name is Yingkai Liu. I am currently a senior undergraduate in Nankai University, China. I major in Physics. 

With more understanding of physics, I found the theory used to describe a phenomenon is more and more elegant but in the same time complicated. I was happy about the differential equations, impressed by linear algebra, struck by group theory and now mesmerized by topology and differential geometry. **I am aware that physics requires much more than *just* mathematics. In the same time I believe that with more mathematics there will be deeper physics.** 

As for my current interest, on my CV I wrote:

> I am interested in the Topological properties of materials and the phenomenon of integer discreetness arising from continuous symmetry. In a different perspective, I am also interested in how particles subject to relatively simple laws can exhibit novel collective properties. I also like coding and enjoy sharing my thoughts.

Here is my [CV](https://yk-liu.github.io/about/CV-of-Liu-Yingkai.pdf) (last update: 2018-11-17).

# This Site

When I started writing on this website, I wanted to share notes on what I have learned. I benefited a lot from many insightful blogs and now I have something to give back. Watching my notes published on websites also gives me motivation and a strange consolation. 

I also realized that this website can be used as a billboard of my professional backgrounds. This is a great proof for what I have learned.

# The Name

I named this website "A Finger Pointing to the Moon", as in the Buddhism story:

> **佛告阿难。汝等尚以缘心听法。此法亦缘。非得法性。**
>
> **若复观指以为月体。此人岂唯亡失月轮。亦亡其指。何以故。以所标指为明月故。**
>
> **岂唯亡指。亦复不识明之与暗。何以故。即以指体。为月明性。明暗二性。无所了故。**

Which has been beautifully put by Bruce Lee:

>It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will all that heavenly glory.
